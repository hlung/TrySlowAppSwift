## Notes:

1. Run on device! not simulator.
1. Pods are already included in git.
1. The "Stop" button in Xcode doesn't really terminate the app. It just send it into background. So if you immediately tap app icon on the phone to open it after you hit Stop in Xcode, it will launch very fast. Try double tap the home button and close the app completely before trying.
